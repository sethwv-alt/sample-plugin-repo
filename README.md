## How It Works

Each plugin lives in `plugins/<plugin-name>/` and must contain a valid `plugin.json`. When a PR is merged to `main`, plugins are automatically packaged and published to the [`releases` branch](https://github.com/sethwv/sample-plugin-repo/tree/releases).

### PR Validation

Every PR runs automated validation that checks:

- Folder name is lowercase-kebab-case
- `plugin.json` is valid and contains required fields
- Version is incremented for existing plugins
- PR author is listed in `owner` or `maintainers`
- `.github/` files are not modified by non-maintainers

Results are posted as a comment on the PR.

### Publishing

On merge to `main`, each plugin is:

- Packaged into a versioned ZIP (`plugin-name-1.0.0.zip`) and a latest ZIP (`plugin-name-latest.zip`)
- Given MD5 and SHA256 checksums
- Listed in `manifest.json` with download URLs and metadata
- Only the 10 most recent versioned ZIPs are kept per plugin

## Contributing

### Adding or Updating a Plugin

1. Fork the repository and create a branch
2. Create or modify your plugin folder under `plugins/your-plugin-name/`
3. Submit a pull request to `main`

For updates, increment the version in `plugin.json`.

### `plugin.json` Required Fields

```json
{
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A brief description of what the plugin does",
  "owner": "github-username"
}
```

- `name`, `version`, `description` are required
- At least one of `owner` or `maintainers` must include your GitHub username - these are not part of the Dispatcharr spec but are required by this repository to manage who can submit PRs for each plugin
- Plugin folder names must be lowercase-kebab-case

**Optional fields:**
- `maintainers` - Array of additional GitHub usernames who can submit PRs for this plugin
- `deprecated` - Marks plugin as deprecated (default: `false`)
- `unlisted` - Hides plugin from the releases README (default: `false`)

## Versioning

Plugins use semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). Version increments are enforced by the validation workflow.

## Downloading Plugins

Visit the [releases branch](https://github.com/sethwv/sample-plugin-repo/tree/releases) to browse and download plugins, or fetch `manifest.json` programmatically:
